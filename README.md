Create a bot once. Put your coding agents to work across your repos.

GitBot runs Claude Code, Codex, or OpenCode on your machine and gives each agent a reusable job, a place to work, and a conversation you can return to. You stay in control of its permissions.

```bash
npm install -g @gitbot-hq/gitbot
```

<br><br><br>

## Get running

You'll need Node.js 18 or newer and at least one installed, signed-in coding agent. GitBot uses your existing agent login; it does not ask you to make a GitBot account.

| Agent | Before you start |
| --- | --- |
| Claude Code | Install and sign in to the `claude` CLI. |
| Codex | Install the `codex` CLI and run `codex login`. |
| OpenCode | Install the `opencode` CLI and configure a provider with `opencode auth login`. |

Install GitBot, then start it from the folder that holds your projects:

```bash
npm install -g @gitbot-hq/gitbot
cd /path/to/your/projects
gitbot start
```

Open **http://localhost:3000** on your computer. GitBot prints a network address and QR code if you want to connect from another device on the same trusted network. The workspace works best on desktop.

> **Before connecting another device:** GitBot prints a sign-in link for this machine. Keep it on a trusted network and never expose the port to the public internet. [Read the security notes](#security-and-privacy).

<br><br><br>

## Create your first bot

A bot is a reusable set of instructions for a coding agent. You decide what it does, which agent runs it, and what it may do without asking.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;
  <img src="assets/mascots/cat.webp" width="80" alt="Cat GitBot mascot">
</p>

1. In the **Bots** panel, select **+** and then **Create manually**.
2. Give the bot a **name** and a short **description** so you can recognize it later.
3. Choose an installed **agent**. Write the bot's standing job in **Instructions**.
4. Leave **Permissions** on **Ask before each tool** for Claude Code or OpenCode. For Codex, **Edit in the working directory** allows edits inside the selected folder; choose **Plan only** for read-only exploration. Add **Setup instructions** only if the bot needs to check or prepare something once on this machine.
5. Select **Create bot**. Open a new thread, choose the repo folder, and send your first message.

For a first bot, try instructions like these:

```text
You review the current repository for documentation that no longer matches the code.
Start by identifying one concrete mismatch. Explain it, propose a small fix,
and ask before editing files.
```

The instructions give the bot its job. Your message gives it today's task. A thread keeps that work together, so you can come back to it later.

| Choose how to create | Define the bot | Start a thread |
| --- | --- | --- |
| <picture><source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="assets/screenshots/create-menu.webp"><source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="assets/screenshots/create-menu-light.webp"><img src="assets/screenshots/create-menu-light.webp" alt="Create, generate, or import a bot from the Bots panel"></picture> | <picture><source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="assets/screenshots/create-bot-form.webp"><source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="assets/screenshots/create-bot-form-light.webp"><img src="assets/screenshots/create-bot-form-light.webp" alt="Create a bot with its name, agent, instructions, permissions, and mascot"></picture> | <picture><source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="assets/screenshots/create-thread.webp"><source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="assets/screenshots/create-thread-light.webp"><img src="assets/screenshots/create-thread-light.webp" alt="Choose a workspace and agent for a new thread"></picture> |

You can also choose **Create with an agent** and give an installed agent the guided authoring prompt, or **Import bot** if someone has shared a code with you. In both cases, review the bot's instructions and permissions before you let it work.

<br><br><br>

## See a bot at work

Choose a repo when you start a thread. The bot runs its agent in that folder and streams the conversation back to GitBot. You can close the browser tab and return to a running turn.

With Claude Code or OpenCode, GitBot shows an approval card when a tool requires permission. Codex has no per-action approval channel, so its selected permission mode chooses a sandbox instead.

<br><br><br>

## How GitBot works

GitBot is a local server between your browser and the coding agents already installed on your machine:

```text
Browser  ->  GitBot on your machine  ->  Claude Code, Codex, or OpenCode
                  |                              |
                  +-- bots and threads           +-- works in your repo
```

- **Bots** hold reusable instructions, an agent choice, permissions, and optional setup steps.
- **Threads** are conversations with a bot in a chosen folder. Each thread stays with the agent that ran its first turn.
- **Setup steps** run in their own thread when a bot first needs preparation on a machine. The bot is not ready for regular work until setup is complete.
- **Your files stay on your machine.** Your chosen coding agent may send prompts and code to its configured provider. GitBot itself does not host the agent or your conversations.

<br><br><br>

## Share a bot, or submit one to Marketplace

**Share with code** copies the bot's settings and instructions so someone else can import it. It does not include chat history or local files. Check the instructions for private details before sharing.

**Publish to Marketplace** shows a prompt you can review and copy into a conversation with the bot. The bot can draft a public listing and prepare a pull request, but it must show you the listing and final diff and wait for your approval. Copying the prompt does not publish anything.

Prefer to submit a listing yourself? Open the [GitBot Library publishing guide](https://github.com/gitbot-hq/Library/blob/main/docs/publish-prompt.md). Marketplace bots live under `bots/<slug>/` in that repository and are reviewed through pull requests.

| Choose how to share | Share with code | Publish to Marketplace |

## Permissions and agent differences

Start with **Ask before tools** for Claude Code or OpenCode. For Codex, use **Read-only** when you do not want edits. Move to broader permissions only when you understand the bot's instructions and trust the repo it is working in. You can change a thread's permission mode from its chat bar. Codex and Plan changes apply from the next message; a broader Claude Code or OpenCode mode can also resolve approvals already waiting in the current reply.

| | Claude Code | OpenCode | Codex |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Approval requests | When a tool requires it | When a tool requires it | No; the selected mode chooses a sandbox |
| Allowed or disallowed tool list | Yes | Yes | Not enforced |
| Resume threads and run setup steps | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Model | Optional | Required as `provider/model` | Optional |

An **Allowed tools** list limits which tools a bot can use; its permission mode decides when to ask. Codex cannot enforce that list, so choose Claude Code or OpenCode when a strict tool fence matters.

<br><br><br>

## Security and privacy

> **Important:** GitBot's API requires a per-machine token. Keep the server on a trusted network, do not expose the port to the internet, and stop GitBot when you are not using it.

Bots act with your user account's file and shell access. Auto-approval removes a chance to inspect individual tool calls. Imported bots may include setup instructions that run when imported, so read them and their permission mode first.

The token is stored at `~/.gitbot/token` (or under `GITBOT_DATA_DIR` if set), with file permissions restricted to your user. Set `GITBOT_TOKEN` to override it. Rotate the token by deleting the token file and restarting GitBot; unset `GITBOT_TOKEN` first if you use the override. `gitbot start` prints a sign-in link that stores the token in an HttpOnly browser cookie. Scripts and other machines can authenticate with `Authorization: Bearer <token>`; run `gitbot token` to print the token.

GitBot has no account, telemetry, or hosted database. Bots and thread records live under `~/.gitbot` by default. Your chosen agent sends prompts and code according to its provider configuration. GitBot also looks up your public IP at startup to print its network address.

<br><br><br>

## Useful commands

```bash
gitbot start                 # use port 3000
gitbot start -p 4000         # choose another port
gitbot start --caffeinate    # keep a Mac awake during long jobs
```

The folder where you run `gitbot start` becomes the workspace shown first in the folder picker. A thread can still run in another folder you can read.

<br><br><br>

## Need help?

| If you see... | Try this |
| --- | --- |
| An agent is missing from the menu | Install and sign in to its CLI, then restart GitBot. |
| Port 3000 is already in use | Run `gitbot start -p 4000`. |
| An imported bot needs an agent you don't have | Install that agent or change the bot's agent. |
| The web UI has not been built | If running from source, run `npm run build`. |

For implementation details, see the [API reference](docs/API.md), [architecture notes](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md), [bot authoring prompt](docs/bot-author-prompt.md), and [web UI guide](ui/README.md).
